SERVICE\n\nTHE UNKNOWN HISTORY OF NVIDIA’S CEO JENSEN HUANG\n© History Oasis\nIn the sun-baked valley of Tainan, Taiwan, 1963, a child was born who\'d one day light up the world with silicon dreams and computer-powered visions—he was named Jensen Huang.\nLike one of them meteoric stories you hear about in the papers, this kid from the East would skip ahead two grades in high school, co-found a little outfit called Nvidia at just thirty years old, and end up revolutionizing the whole dang world of computing with his GPU breakthrough that made artificial intelligence what it is today.\n‍\nJENSEN WAS BORN IN 1963 IN TAINAN, TAIWAN\n\n© History Oasis\n‍\nIn 1963, the course of technology history was forever altered in Tainan, Taiwan with the birth of Jen-Hsun "Jensen" Huang, the future co-founder and CEO of graphics processing pioneer Nvidia.\nThough his family uprooted to Thailand when he was just five years old, they would eventually settle in the United States where Jensen\'s technology career would eventually blossom.\nThis early international upbringing may have sparked Jensen\'s innovative global perspective which drove him to make Nvidia a dominant force in visual computing on the international stage.\n‍\nHE SKIPPED TWO GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n© History Oasis\n‍\nJensen Huang skipped two grades in high school, graduating at age 16 in 1979.\nHis strong academic performance accelerated his education path, setting an early foundation for his later innovations in computer technology.\nEven as a teenager, Huang was already moving swiftly toward his future role in shaping the tech industry.\n‍\nJENSEN STUDIED ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING\n\n© History Oasis\n‍\nWith an insatiable appetite for electronics and technology, Jensen Huang embarked on an electrical engineering academic journey that took him from Oregon State University for his bachelor\'s degree to the halls of Stanford University where in 1992 he was awarded a Master\'s degree in his field.\nThis elite technical schooling equipped him with the cutting-edge engineering proficiency to eventually lead Nvidia\'s breakthroughs in graphics processing units and parallel computing, which would revolutionize modern AI and data centers.\n‍\nIN 1993 AT AGE 30, JENSEN CO-FOUNDED NVIDIA\n\n© History Oasis\n‍\nIn 1993, an ambitious 30-year old Jensen Huang joined forces with two Silicon Valley compatriots, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, to launch the bold upstart Nvidia and inaugurate a new era of visual computing.\nServing as its chief executive for over three decades since its humble beginnings, Jensen\'s technological vision and business savvy has steered Nvidia\'s ascendance to the forefront of advanced GPU technologies propelling modern AI and the global information economy.\n‍\nUNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, NVIDIA PIONEERED THE GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT (GPU)\n\n© History Oasis\n‍\nJensen Huang transformed Nvidia from a graphics startup into a global technology leader by developing the graphics processing unit (GPU) in the late 1990s.\nWhile early critics doubted the GPU\'s potential, Huang\'s focused vision proved correct.\nThe technology first revolutionized computer graphics, then enabled breakthroughs in gaming, industrial design, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.\nUnder Huang\'s technical and strategic leadership, Nvidia\'s GPU technology became essential to modern computing, particularly in advancing artificial intelligence applications.\n‍\nJENSEN OWNS ABOUT 4% OF NVIDIA\'S STOCK\n\n© History Oasis\n‍\nAs Nvidia\'s fortunes rose meteorically through the turn of the millennium thanks to Jensen’s visionary leadership in graphics technologies, so too did the value of his ownership stake, amounting to approximately 4% of the company’s stock at its initial public offering in 1999, which funded aggressive growth.\nThis prescient bet yielded immense dividends for Jensen as Nvidia ascended to tech elite status, enabling him as chief executive to garner impressive annual compensation of $24.6 million by 2007.\nA figure rivaling top industry CEOs and underscoring his integral role in Nvidia’s emergence as a leading Silicon Valley innovator.\n‍\nAS OF FEBRUARY 2024, JENSEN\'S NET WORTH STANDS AT $64.1 BILLION\n\n© History Oasis\n‍\nThrough his storied three-decade career leading GPU pioneer Nvidia from scrappy startup to world technology leader, Jensen Huang has amassed a monumental personal fortune fitting of Silicon Valley royalty.\nAs of February 2024, his net worth has ballooned to an astounding $64.1 billion, securing his place among the top 25 most affluent individuals on the planet.\nThis staggering level of wealth accumulation speaks to Jensen\'s rare talent for repeatedly disrupting industries with Nvidia\'s graphics breakthroughs, generation after generation, making him one of history’s most successful serial technology entrepreneurs and cementing his legacy as a silicon titan reshaping the globe’s AI-driven future.\n‍\nHE HAS RECEIVED NUMEROUS AWARDS & HONORS OVER THE YEARS\n\n© History Oasis\n‍\nOver his illustrious three decade career as Nvidia\'s visionary leader, Jensen Huang has earned copious recognition and honors befitting his technology icon status, including multiple honorary doctorates conferring his seminal contributions to fields from graphics processing and AI to computing and electronics.\nThese distinguished accolades signify the immense respect Jensen commands as a generational tech CEO who time and again has fearlessly led

Under Huang’s leadership, NVIDIA has become one of the leading providers of graphics processing units (GPUs) and has taken center stage in the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\nHuang was born the second son of Taiwan citizens Huang Hsing-tai and Lo Tsai-hsiu. Huang’s father was a chemical engineer, and his mother taught grade school. When he was five, the family moved to Thailand. However, due to the then-ongoing Vietnam War, Huang’s parents decided that they wouldn’t settle in Thailand permanently. Huang’s father had previously been accepted into a worker-training program at the American air conditioner manufacturer Carrier and had formed a positive impression of the United States. Huang’s mother helped prepare Huang and his brother for the eventual move by teaching them 10 random English words a day.\nWhen Huang was nine years old, he and his brother were sent to live with their uncle in Tacoma, Washington, while their parents stayed in Thailand. Shortly thereafter, Huang’s uncle sent them to the all-boys Oneida Baptist Institute in rural Oneida, Kentucky, mistakenly believing it to be a prestigious boarding school. In fact, the institute was a religious reform school for “difficult” children. Huang was forced to clean toilets every day while his brother worked on a tobacco farm. The boys were relentlessly bullied by fellow students, were called ethnic slurs, and were even threatened with knives.\nAbout two years later, Huang’s parents arrived in the United States, discovered the situation, and pulled their children out of Oneida. The reunited family settled in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon, where Huang attended Aloha High School. While there, Huang played competitive table tennis and earned a national ranking. He graduated in 1981 and subsequently attended Oregon State University (OSU). At OSU, Huang met Lori Mills, a fellow engineering student, and the pair later married.\nHuang graduated with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from OSU in 1984. He moved to Silicon Valley, where he took a job with Advanced Micro Devices. He remained there for about a year before accepting a job at the LSI Logic Corporation, where he rose through the ranks and eventually became director of a company division. While working, he returned to school and obtained a master’s degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.\nIn April 1993 Huang founded NVIDIA with fellow microchip designers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, who selected Huang to serve as CEO. The trio aimed to create GPUs for the video game industry. The trio began with $40,000 in capital but soon procured an initial investment of $20 million from venture capital firms. With this backing, NVIDIA survived a difficult first few years and eventually gained a solid position in the semiconductor market. The company went public in 1999. When its stock price hit $100 per share, Huang got a tattoo of the company’s logo on his left shoulder.\nHuang got a tattoo of the NVIDIA company logo when the company’s stock price hit $100 per share, but he has admitted that he would most likely not get another tattoo.\nNVIDIA grew beyond the gaming industry, reaching into fields such as artificial intelligence, mobile computing, autonomous vehicle technology, and social networking. In fact, with its powerful GPUs, NVIDIA helped to power the AI revolution. Such chips, though they were initially designed for game development, were also discovered to be viable candidates for running machine learning algorithms. Huang’s wealth and profile grew in tandem. The worth of his 3.5 percent of NVIDIA stock made him a billionaire, and he became one of the highest-paid CEOs in the United States.\n\nOpen full sized image\nNVIDIA\'s GPUs were highly sought-after for their unparalleled computing power and ability to power AI applications.\nBerkut\nIn 2007 Huang and his wife founded the philanthropic Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, which made donations to the Huangs’ alma maters, to public health initiatives, and to various San Francisco Bay Area organizations. In 2017 Fortune magazine named Huang its Businessperson of the Year, and in 2019 Harvard Business Review ranked him as the world’s best-performing CEO. In 2021 Time magazine included him on its annual list of the world’s hundred most influential people.\nAt the 2018 GPU Technology Conference held by NVIDIA in San Jose, Huang remarked that NVIDIA’s GPUs were 25 times faster than they had been five years prior and thus were advancing more rapidly than Moore’s law had suggested that they would. The press immediately dubbed this observation—that GPU performance was more than doubling every two years—“Huang’s law.”\nAdam Volle\n\nAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & Conditions\n© 2025 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.',

After graduating from Stanford University, he launched Nvidia in 1993 from a local Denny\'s restaurant at the age of 30 and has remained president and CEO since its founding. Huang led the company out of near-bankruptcy during the 1990s and oversaw its expansion into GPU production, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence.\nUnder Huang, Nvidia experienced rapid growth during the AI boom and reached a market capitalization of $3 trillion, surpassing Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta.[4] In June 2024, Nvidia overtook Microsoft to be the "world\'s most valuable company" with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion.[5] In 2021 and 2024, Time magazine named Huang as one of the most influential people in the world.\nEarly life and education[edit]\nHuang was born in Taipei, Taiwan, on February 17, 1963,[6] and moved to the southern city of Tainan as a child.[7] He is the younger of two sons of Huang Hsing-tai, a chemical engineer at an oil refinery, and Lo Tsai-hsiu, a schoolteacher.[8] They were a middle-class Taiwanese family that relocated often.[6] Each day, Jensen\'s mother randomly selected ten words from the dictionary to teach her sons English.[9] When he was five years old, Huang\'s family moved to Thailand to support his father\'s refinery work and remained there for approximately four years.[10][7] He attended Ruamrudee International School while in Bangkok.[11]\nIn the late 1960s, Hsing-tai traveled from Taiwan to New York City to train under an air conditioning company and, after returning home, resolved to send his sons to the United States.[12] At age nine, Jensen, despite not being able to speak English, was sent by his parents to live in the US.[13] He and his older brother moved in 1973 to reside with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington, escaping widespread social unrest in Thailand.[14] Both Huang\'s aunt and uncle were recent immigrants to Washington state; they accidentally enrolled him and his brother in the Oneida Baptist Institute, a religious reform academy in Kentucky for troubled youth,[14] mistakenly believing it to be a prestigious boarding school.[15] In order to afford the academy\'s tuition, Jensen\'s parents sold nearly all their possessions.[16]\nWhen he was ten years old, Huang lived with his brother in the Oneida boys\' dormitory.[15] Each student was expected to work every day, and his older brother was assigned to perform manual labor on a nearby tobacco farm.[16] Because he was too young to attend classes at the reform academy, Huang was educated at a separate public school—the Oneida Elementary school in Oneida, Kentucky—arriving as "an undersized Asian immigrant with long hair and heavily accented English"[15] and was frequently bullied and beaten.[17] In Oneida, Huang cleaned toilets everyday, learned to play table-tennis,[b] joined the swimming team,[19] and appeared in Sports Illustrated at age 14.[20] He taught his illiterate roommate, a "17-year-old covered in tattoos and knife scars,"[20] how to read in exchange for being taught how to bench press.[15] In 2002, Huang recalled that he remembered his life in Kentucky "more vividly than just about any other".[20]\nTwo years after Huang arrived in Oneida, his parents moved to the United States and settled in Beaverton, Oregon, where the brothers withdrew from school in Kentucky to live back with them.[21] As a teenager, Huang attended Aloha High School in Aloha, Oregon,[22] where he excelled academically. He skipped two grades, graduated at age sixteen, and became a nationally ranked table-tennis player in addition to being a member of its mathematics, computer, and science clubs.[15] Beginning at age 15,[23] Huang also got his first job working the graveyard shift[24] at a local Denny\'s restaurant as a dishwasher, busboy, and waiter from 1978 to 1983.[25][26]\nAfter high school, Huang chose to enroll in Oregon State University due to its low in-state tuition.[27] He studied electrical engineering and computer science and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1984 at age 20.[28] He later recalled, "I was the youngest kid in school, in class" and the only student who "looked like a child".[29] Years later, while working as a microchip designer in Silicon Valley, he concurrently pursued graduate night classes at Stanford University, where he earned a master\'s degree in electrical engineering in 1992.[15][30]\nAMD and LSI Logic[edit]\nAfter graduating from college, Huang was a microchip designer in Silicon Valley.[15] He had interviewed for positions at Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and LSI Logic, ultimately choosing the California-based AMD due to already being familiar with the company. He designed AMD microprocessors while simultaneously attending Stanford and raising his two children. However, when he heard of new chip design processes at LSI Logic, Huang left AMD to assume a role as a technical officer at the LSI Corporation, working under a startup company, Sun Microsystems, where he met engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem.[31]\nLSI was in contract with Sun Microsystems and had introduced Huang to Malachowsky and Priem, who were working on a new graphics accelerator card. While the three produced the card\'s manufacturing process, the relationship between Malachowsky and Priem became strained as the two disputed the chip\'s design, leading to infighting; according to Malachowsky, they "broke every tool that LSI Logic had in their standard portfolio".[32] In 1989, Huang, Malachowsky, and Priem finalized the accelerator, which they called the "GX graphics engine".[33] GX was a widespread financial success; the sales of the graphics engine contributed to Sun Microsystem\'s revenue increasing from $262 million in 1987 to $656 million in 1990, and Huang was promoted to be the director of LSI\'s CoreWare, a division that manufactured chips for hardware vendors.[34]\nNvidia[edit]\nFounding (1993)[edit]\nHuang founded Nvidia Corporation after meeting with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in a Denny\'s diner in East San Jose (pictured). As a teenager, Huang was previously an employee at a Denny\'s restaurant in Oregon.\nWhen business began to slow for Sun Microsystems after 1990, Huang, along with Priem and Malachowsky, each resigned their jobs to pursue a venture together in making graphics chips for PC games.[35] They initially named their new company "NVision" until Huang suggested that the company be named "Nvidia" based on the Latin word invidia, as Priem wanted competitors to turn "green with envy".[15] The three met frequently in 1992 at a Denny\'s roadside diner in East San Jose to formulate a business plan.[36] Huang chose for them to meet at Denny\'s due to his prior work experience at the restaurant chain and because it was "quieter than home and had cheap coffee".[15] The three founded the company during one meeting at the Denny\'s diner at a breakfast booth.[37][38]\nTo formally incorporate the company, Huang found a lawyer, James Gaither of Cooley Godward, who demanded the $200 in cash in Huang\'s pockets to capitalize the company. After that meeting, Huang went back to Priem and Malachowsky to ask each of them for $200 for their respective shares of the company, which meant that Nvidia\'s initial capital was $600.[39] On April 5, 1993, Huang personally signed Nvidia\'s original articles of incorporation into effect.[1]\nAlthough he left LSI, Huang remained in good standing with the company and was able to secure funding for Nvidia from LSI\'s CEO, Wilfred Corrigan, who introduced Huang to venture capitalist Don Valentine. Valentine, the leader of Sequoia Capital, chose to invest in Nvidia, as did Sutter Hill Ventures. The funding enabled Nvidia to begin development efforts toward its first chip and to begin paying wages for its employees.[40] By the first day of operation, Huang was made Nvidia\'s president and CEO.[41] Even though Huang, at age 30, was younger than Priem and Malachowsky, both Priem and Malachowsky believed that he was prepared to be CEO.[15] According to Priem, "we basically deferred to Jensen on day one" and told Huang, "you\'re in charge of running the company—all the stuff Chris and I don’t know how to do".[42][c]\nPresident and CEO (1993–)[edit]\nAs of 2024, Huang has been Nvidia\'s chief executive for over three decades, a tenure described by The Wall Street Journal as "almost unheard of in fast-moving Silicon Valley".[43] He owns 3.6% of Nvidia\'s stock, which went public in 1999.[3] He earned US$24.6 million as CEO in 2007, ranking him as the 61st highest paid U.S. CEO by Forbes.[3]\nHuang meeting with Narendra Modi in 2023\nAccording to Huang, the three co-founders in 1993 had "no idea how" to start a company,[38] "building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder" than they expected, and they probably would not have done it if they had realized up front "the pain and suffering [involved] ... the challenges [they were] going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that [would] go wrong."[44] For its first graphics accelerator chips, Nvidia focused on rendering quadrilateral primitives (forward texture mapping) instead of the triangle primitives preferred by its competitors,[15] and barely survived long enough to successfully pivot to triangles only because Sega agreed to keep Nvidia alive with a $5 million investment.[45] By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997 and saved the company, Nvidia was down to one month of payroll.[15] This resulted in the "unofficial company motto": "Our company is thirty days from going out of business."[15] Huang regularly began presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years.[15] However, Huang regards the "pain and suffering" of Nvidia\'s early years as essential to the company\'s success in later years, because it forced him to become a better leader.[46]\nHuang does not keep a fixed office; he roams Nvidia\'s headquarters and settles temporarily in conference rooms as needed.[47] He prefers to maintain a relatively flat management structure, with around 60 direct reports as of November 2024,[48] on the ground that people reporting directly to him "should be at the top of their game" and "require the least amount of pampering".[49] He does not wear a watch, because as he likes to say, "now is the most important time".[43]\nHistorically, Huang and Nvidia were well-known only among the gamers and computer graphics experts who were the original intended markets for Nvidia\'s graphics processing unit (GPU) products. In 2017, a Fortune profile article acknowledged: "If you haven’t heard of Nvidia, you can be forgiven."[47] During the AI boom, Huang\'s net worth rose rapidly along with the value of Nvidia\'s stock, from US$3 billion in 2019 to US$90 billion in May 2024.[50] During this same timeframe, Huang became more widely known. In March 2024, Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Instagram with a picture of himself and Huang wearing each other\'s signature jacket: "He\'s like Taylor Swift, but for tech".[51]\nIn June 2024, Nvidia\'s market capitalization reached US$3 trillion for the first time and Huang\'s net worth grew to US$100 billion.[52] By then, the news media was using the term "Jensanity" to refer to Huang\'s celebrity status in Taiwan,[52] and it was compared to the "Linsanity" phenomenon of 2012.[10] Huang was the center of attention at Computex 2024 in Taipei, even though he was not on the official speaking program.[52] Large crowds of fans and paparazzi followed Huang and his family members around every time they appeared in public during their 2024 visit to Taiwan.[52][10]\nIn January 2025, Huang delivered the keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.[53] During this keynote, Huang made a number of announcements such as a new gaming chip called the GeForce RTX 50-series, new chips for both PCs and laptops,[53] an agreement to provide Toyota self-driving vehicles with Nvidia\'s Drive AGX Orin supercomputer and operating system called DriveOS,[54] and the release of Cosmos, a series of foundational AI models designed to support the development of self-driving cars, humanoid robots and industrial robots.[55]\nPhilanthropy[edit]\nIn 2008, Nvidia contributed funds to establish a classroom at the Beijing Haidian Foreign Language Shi Yan School to cater to 101 elementary and middle school students from regions affected by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China. As a gesture of appreciation for the donation, the students ceremoniously bestowed a red scarf upon Huang, symbolizing their gratitude towards him. In return, Huang gifted kaleidoscopes to the students as a gesture of appreciation during the donation ceremony.[56] In addition, Huang also provided a donation of US$30 million to his former university, Stanford University, to establish the Jen-Hsun Huang School of Engineering Center.[57] The building is the second of four that make up Stanford\'s Science and Engineering Quad.[58]\nIn 2019, Huang donated $2 million to his former school, Oneida Baptist Institute, for the construction of Huang Hall, a modern facility that serves as a dormitory and classroom building for female students.[59]\nIn 2022, Huang gifted US$50 million to his alma mater, Oregon State University, as part of a larger US$200 million philanthropic contribution to establish a cutting-edge supercomputing institute on the university campus.[60]\nAwards[edit]\nJensen Huang at SC18\nJensen Huang in Taipei\n1999: Named Entrepreneur of the Year in High Technology by Ernst & Young[61]\n2002: Received the Daniel J.

Hinton, John Hopfield, Yann LeCun and Fei-Fei Li.[85]\nPersonal life[edit]\nWhile at Oregon State University, Huang met his future wife, Lori Mills, who was his engineering lab partner at the time.[15] They have two children, Spencer Huang (Chinese: 黃勝斌; pinyin: Huáng Shèngbīn) and Madison Huang (Chinese: 黃敏珊; pinyin: Huáng Mǐnshān).[47] Spencer launched a bar in Taipei in 2015 that was honored as one of the top 50 bars in Asia by Forbes. The bar closed in May 2021, and he is currently a product manager at Nvidia. Madison previously worked in the hotel industry and is currently director of product marketing at Nvidia.[86]\nThe Huang family lived in ordinary middle-class starter homes in San Jose before Nvidia went public in 1999.[87] In 2003, they moved to a larger house in Los Altos Hills, California, and in 2004 they acquired a second home in Wailea, Hawaii.[87] In 2017, a limited liability company reportedly linked to the Huangs acquired a mansion in San Francisco for $38 million.[87]\nHuang and AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su are relatives.[88] His mother is the youngest sister of Su\'s maternal grandfather, making them first cousins, once removed.[89][90] Huang also speaks Taiwanese Hokkien,[91] and has dual Taiwanese and American citizenship.[92] He makes frequent visits back to Taiwan.[93]\nHuang and Charles Liang, co-founder of Supermicro, are longtime friends. Both companies were established in 1993 and have collaborated on products, with the latter utilizing Nvidia AI chips in its servers.[94] Huang is also a close friend of TSMC founder Morris Chang.[95]\nSee also[edit]\nHuang\'s law\nNotes[edit]\n^ Huang consistently capitalizes the second syllable of his given name in legal documents. For example, on April 5, 1993, he signed Nvidia\'s original articles of incorporation as Jen-Hsun Huang.[1]\n^ According to Forbes, Huang "placed third in junior doubles at the U.S. Table Tennis Open championship, at age 15" in 1978.[18]\n^ In a 2011 interview at Stanford University, Huang recalled that Priem said, "Jensen, you’re the CEO, right?

Based in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA holds approximately 80 percent of the global market share in GPU semiconductor chips as of 2023.\nUnlike general-purpose central processing unit (CPU) semiconductor chips, GPUs are built to speed up graphics-intensive applications such as video games, editing, and 3D rendering as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications. NVIDIA has been at the forefront of GPU technology for over 25 years and is one of its early pioneers.\n Britannica Quiz Computers and Technology Quiz\nHaving established itself as one of the world’s leading chip producers specializing in GPU technology, NVIDIA also positioned itself as one of the main suppliers of both AI hardware and software. Its breakout moment in the industry took place in 2022, when OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI chatbot became available to the general public. OpenAI developed its technology using a supercomputer powered by 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs.\nOperational characteristics and key products\nNVIDIA’s focus on GPU technology, in contrast to the prevailing CPU technology, was a key factor in establishing both its market differentiation and competitive advantages.\nWhether by design or inherent capacity and improvement, GPU technology excels at parallel processing—utilizing more cores in order to allow multiple processes to run simultaneously. In comparison, CPUs utilize serial processing, which generally requires the completion of one process before the next one can begin.\nBy concentrating its research and production on GPUs, NVIDIA significantly advanced chip capacity within the semiconductor industry.\nNVIDIA was also able to accelerate its own chip manufacturing process to produce a new chip every six months, as opposed to the historical industry average of 18 months. This process advantage gave NVIDIA an edge in its production cycle as well as its capacity to quickly improve and implement new technologies through significant R&D investments. Key products include:\n\nGeForce GTX and RTX series. Used primarily in gaming and professional workstation applications.\nNVIDIA A and H series and DGX systems. Supports artificial intelligence (AI) and data center applications.\nNVIDIA Tegra series. Designed for small devices such as car components, smartphones, and handheld electronics.\nNVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX SmartNICs and Quantum InfiniBand. GPUs utilized in cloud applications, data storage, and machine learning.\nCUDA, AI Enterprise, and Drive. GPUs tailored for software developers (DRIVE being specifically designed for developers of self-driving car software).\n\nThe 1990s: Founding years to IPO\nNVIDIA Corporation was founded in April 1993 by three American computer scientists: Jen-Hsun (“Jensen”) Huang, previously a director at LSI Logic and microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, a senior staff engineer and graphic chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.\nThe name NVIDIA is an amalgamation of two terms: invidia, the Latin word for “envy,” and the acronym NV (short for “next vision”), which the company used early on to label its files. In the year of its founding, the company received an initial investment of $20 million in venture capital funding from firms such as Sequoia Capital, giving it the early financial support and market credibility that would lead to its initial public offering (IPO) six years later, in 1999.\nThe company’s initial focus was on graphics-based computing and video games. This would become a major differentiating factor and, in time, a competitive advantage for NVIDIA. The company would become a pioneer of GPU technology, capitalizing on its multicore and parallel processing speed—both lacking in standard CPU processes.\nIn 1997, NVIDIA gained a foothold in the computer gaming industry with the launch of the RIVA series of graphics processors. The following year, 1998, the company released the Riva TNT, a PC graphics accelerator chip that helped expand NVIDIA’s reputation.\nIn 1999, the year the company went public, NVIDIA released the GeForce 256. This product introduced onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-grade hardware. The success of these products won NVIDIA the contract to develop the hardware for the Xbox, Microsoft’s gaming console. NVIDIA received a $200 million advance for the project.\nThe 2000s: Gaming, real-world applications, and controversy\nOver the next decade, NVIDIA would solidify its position as a formidable gaming console chip supplier. In the middle of the decade, Sony would select NVIDIA to assist in the design of the RSX Reality Synthesizer proprietary graphics processor for the Sony PlayStation 3.\nHowever, the early 2000s also saw NVIDIA’s shift beyond the gaming industry, a move that the company would expand on throughout most of the decade. In 2003, NVIDIA worked with NASA to develop a photorealistic Mars simulation. NVIDIA also became a major graphics chip supplier for a number of Audi’s vehicles.\nThe company’s growth was publicly recognized when, in 2007, NVIDIA was named the Forbes “Company of the Year.” Soon after this crowning accolade, however, the company would face a series of setbacks that would mire the chipmaker in legal hurdles and lost business opportunities.\nAt the center were reports that certain mobile chips and GPUs had “abnormal failure rates” as a result of manufacturing defects. Despite the red flags, the company would not reveal which products were affected. As a consequence, NVIDIA found itself on the receiving end of a class-action lawsuit, which was settled in September 2010.\nIn January 2011, NVIDIA signed a $1.5 billion cross-licensing deal with IBM, which ended all pending litigation between the two firms.\nThe 2010s: Parallel computing and AI technology\nLuckily, or perhaps with keen forward-leaning insight, the company’s development in parallel computing technology would not only help the chip manufacturer recover from its end-of-decade slump, but would also help launch the company’s leading position in a then-remote field: artificial intelligence (AI).\nParallel computing is a computational paradigm that consists of breaking down a single problem into several sub-parts and then solving them simultaneously using multiple processors. Ultimately, it allows for faster execution. And it’s exactly the kind of computational speed and power that’s needed to develop and run sophisticated AI applications.\nNVIDIA’s seminal step toward later AI and deep learning technology began back in 2006, when it released its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform, a major innovation in GPU-based parallel computing technology.\nWhile the company continued to develop—and eventually monetize—AI technology, it added other revenue drivers to its core gaming enterprise.\n\nGrowth through acquisition. Strategic acquisition has been part of NVIDIA’s growth since its purchase in 2000 of graphics card maker 3Dfx Interactive. Its 2011 acquisition of mobile communications equipment maker Icera, followed by compiler tech maker PGI in 2013, kicked off a decade in which NVIDIA used its resources not only to fill technology gaps but also to enter new markets. By the end of the decade, NVIDIA had initiated more than a dozen acquisitions.\nMobile computing. In 2011 NVIDIA released its first-generation Tegra—its mobile processor for smartphones, tablets, entertainment systems, and vehicle navigation. Tegra is a system-on-a-chip (SoC) series.\nAdvanced vehicle technologies. In 2017 the company announced a partnership with automaker Toyota, which would use NVIDIA’s Drive PX artificial intelligence platform for its own self-driving cars. The NVIDIA Drive chip enables vehicles to analyze the surrounding environment via cameras and radar and lidar technologies. NVIDIA also partnered with Baidu, a Chinese multinational technology conglomerate, which uses the Drive PX series in its self-driving car initiative.\nMetaverse. In 2020, NVIDIA released its beta version of Omniverse, which leveraged NVIDIA’s graphics leadership to develop 3D imaging, design, and engineering.\n\nThe 2020s: The AI renaissance, regulatory scrutiny, and the one that got away\nAlthough corporate acquisitions are commonplace in the corporate landscape, NVIDIA’s dominant market position in the chip industry has placed it under the scope of antitrust watchdogs and regulators. For example, it was 2006 when NVIDIA received its first subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations.\nRegulatory scrutiny of NVIDIA reached a fever pitch in 2020, however, after its attempted $40 billion purchase of Arm Ltd., which was then held by tech investing giant SoftBank. When combined with NVIDIA’s GPU dominance, Arm (whose chip technology powers hundreds of devices, including Apple iPhones and iPads, Amazon Kindles, and many automobile makes and models) met resistance by regulators across the globe. The deal was ultimately scrapped in 2022.\nBut it was also in 2022 that NVIDIA’s investment in artificial intelligence paid off. By focusing on processing speed and production speed, and by investing heavily in deep learning and AI applications, NVIDIA was able to not only expand on GPU capabilities but also contribute greatly to AI innovation. When word got out that OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform—which set off a global rush toward AI technology— was built upon 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs, rival platforms clamored for NVIDIA chips (and investors clamored for NVIDIA shares).\nBut the move would also trigger another round of regulatory oversight, not just because of NVIDIA’s dominance (as of 2023 NVIDIA claimed that 70 percent of the world’s fastest supercomputers worldwide were using its chips) but also because of uncertainty surrounding AI and its impacts on society, culture, and employment. In September 2023, for example, NVIDIA’s French offices were raided in a cloud computing antitrust inquiry. Regulatory bodies in the European Union and in China and other countries also initiated a close examination of NVIDIA’s practices and overall position in the AI industry.\nThe future of NVIDIA lies in its continued innovation in hardware and software solutions, in the potentially transformative impact of artificial intelligence, and in using its dominant position in GPUs to help shape the landscape of emerging technologies.\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated by Tara Ramanathan.\n\nAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & Conditions\n© 2025 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.',

Those features alone weren\'t enough to appeal to the market though as the Saturn was struggling to compete with the original PlayStation.\n\nNV1 was off to a rough start that was made worse by the release of Microsoft DirectX which was incompatible with the GPU and many games would not run.\n\nNvidia RIVA 128\n\nIn 1997 Nvidia released the NV3 aka Riva 128, Riva stood for "Real-time Interactive Video and Animation". This graphics card used both 2D and 3D acceleration along with polygon texture mapping.\n\nAt the time Nvidia\'s rival 3dfx was dominating the market but the NV3 had a 100MHz core/memory clock and essentially doubled the spec of 3dfx\'s Voodoo 1.\n\nThere were two variants of the NV3 in the form of the Riva 128 and the Riva 128ZX. The latter was more powerful with 8MB of VRAM and a 250MHz clock speed.\n\nThe NV3 was much more successful than the company\'s first GPU and helped Nvidia get widespread popularity.\n\nNvidia NV4\n\nIn 1998, Nvidia unleashed NV4, aka Riva TNT. This graphics card improved over the previous models by including support for 32-bit True Colour. The NV4 also had more RAM with 16MB of SDR SDRAM which meant it offered greater performance too.\n\nIt was around this time that Nvidia started to make moves to regularly update graphics drivers to ensure good performance and compatibility for the end user, something the company is still doing to this day.\n\nNvidia\'s Riva TNT was more affordable at the time than 3dfx\'s Vodoo2 if a little slower in terms of performance. The driver support was key to NV4\'s success.\n\nNvidia NV5\n\nIn 1999, Nvidia followed up NV4 with the RIVA TNT2. NV5, as it was codenamed, bought a number of updates including 32-bit Z-buffer/stencil support, up to 32MB of VRAM and 2048 x 2048 texture support.\n\nMore importantly, this graphics card had improved clock speeds (up to 150+ MHz) which gave it as much as a 17 per cent performance boost over the previous model.\n\nThis card was a direct competitor to the 3dfx Voodoo3 and both were incredibly popular.\n\nNvidia GeForce 256\n\nLate in 1999, Nvidia released what it pitched as the "world\'s first GPU" in the form of the Nvidia GeForce 256.\n\nThis was a clever marketing move from Nvidia and the beginning of a love affair with GeForce-branded graphics cards for years to come.\n\nIt improved upon previous RIVA cards by increasing the pixel pipelines but also offered a big leap in performance for PC gaming.\n\nThis card supported up to 64MB of DDR SDRAM and operated up to 166MHz. As such it was 50 per cent faster than the NV5.\n\nMore importantly, the GeForce 256 also fully supported Direct3D 7 which meant it could power many of the best PC games available at the time.\n\nShortly after this launch 3dfx went bankrupt and ATI became Nvidia\'s main competitor.\n\nNvidia GeForce2\n\nNvidia followed up the world\'s first GPU with the aptly named GeForce2.\n\nThis GPU came in several different variants including the Ti, Pro, GTS and Ultra models. These were essentially NV11, 15 and 16 cards. Increasing pipelines and higher clock rates followed throughout the 2000 and 2001 releases.\n\nThe thing that made GeForce2 interesting was the start of support for multi-monitor setups.\n\nIt was also around this time that Nvidia acquired 3dfx.\n\nNvidia GeForce3\n\nShortly after GeForce2 came GeForce3. Codenamed NV20, this series of graphics cards represented Nvidia\'s first DirectX 8 compatible GPUs.\n\nThere were three versions - the GeForce3, GeForce3 Ti 200, and GeForce3 Ti 500. This next GeForce GPU added programmable pixel and vertex shaders, multisample anti-aliasing into the mix.\n\nA version of GeForce3 referred to as NV2A was used in the original Xbox console.\n\nNvidia GeForce FX series\n\nLeap forward a couple of generations and in 2003 we have the release of Nvidia\'s GeForce FX series.\n\nThese were the fifth generation of the GeForce graphics cards and supported Direct3D 9 as well as a number of new memory technologies. Those included DDR2, GDDR2 and GDDR3 as well as Nvidia\'s first attempt at a memory data bus wider than 128 bits.\n\nMeanwhile, the GeForce FX 5800 made waves for being the first GPU to be equipped with a large cooler. One so big that it was often called the "dustbuster" because of the amount of fan noise it gave off.\n\nNvidia GeForce 6 series\n\nShortly after the release of the GeForce FX series came the 6 series (aka NV40). GeForce 6 was the start of Nvidia pushing SLI technology allowing people to combine more than one graphics card for more power.\n\nThe flagship of this range was the GeForce 6800 Ultra, a graphics card which boasted 222 million transistors, 16-pixel superscalar pipelines and six vertex shaders. It had Shader Model 3.0 support and was compliant with both Microsoft DirectX 9.0c and OpenGL 2.0.\n\nThe series also featured Nvidia PureVideo technology and was able to decode H.264, VC-1, WMV and MPEG-2 videos with reduced CPU use.\n\nAs a result of all this, the GeForce 6 series was highly successful.\n\nNvidia GeForce7 series\n\nIn 2005 came the GeForce7 series including the highlight thought of 7800 GTX.\n\nThat card alone was a real powerhouse for the time and with some clever cooling, Nvidia was able to push the clock speed to 550MHz. At the same time, the company also managed to reduce latency and increase the bus to 512 bit.\n\nInterestingly a version of the 7 series was crafted as the RSX Reality Synthesizer which was the proprietary CPU co-created by Nvidia and Sony for the PlayStation 3.\n\nNvidia GeForce8 series\n\nIn 2006 Nvidia released the GeForce8 series and unveiled its Tesla microarchitecture. This was the company\'s first unified shader design and would be one of its most used architectures in future cards too.\n\nThe much-loved Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTX was the flagship of the range and was incredibly popular. It boasted 681 million transistors, had 768MB of GDDR3 memory and came with 128 shaders clocked at 575MHz.\n\nMost significantly, this graphics card could run Crysis, which was all that PC gamers wanted at the time.\n\nIn 2006 things were also heating up as AMD purchased ATI for $5.4 billion and would become a thorn in Nvidia\'s side for years to come.\n\nNvidia GeForce9 series\n\nAt the start of 2008 Nvidia released the GeForce9 series. These cards continued to use the Tesla architecture but also added PCIe 2.0 support, improved colour and z-compression too.\n\nBy this time Nvidia was pushing performance up a notch with clock speeds hitting up to 675MHz and yet power consumption was being reduced as well.\n\nNvidia GeForce 400 series\n\nThe next significant update came in 2010 when Nvidia launched the GeForce 4000 series. This was when Nvidia revealed the Fermi microarchitecture which was the company\'s next major architecture.\n\nThis series also saw support for OpenGL 4.0 and Direct3D 11 and was a direct competitor to the Radeon HD 5000 Series.\n\nHowever, the series was let down by high running temperatures and power consumption which caused a lot of grumbles from users.\n\nNvidia GeForce 600 series\n\nThe GeForce 600 series introduced Nvidia\'s Kepler architecture which was designed to increase performance per watt while also improving upon the performance of the previous Fermi microarchitecture.\n\nWith Kepler, Nvidia managed to increase the memory clock to 6GHz. It also added GPU Boost which guaranteed the GPU would be able to run at a minimum clock speed, but also boost performance when needed until it reached a pre-defined power target.\n\nThis range also supported both Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12. It also introduced a new anti-aliasing method known as TXAA.\n\nNvidia GeForce 700 series\n\nIn 2013 Nvidia kicked things up a notch with the 700 series which was topped off with the insane high-end enthusiast GTX Titan card.\n\nThis series was a refresh of the Kepler microarchitecture but some later cards also featured Femi and Maxwell architectures.\n\nThe GTX Titan boasted 2688 CUDA cores, 224 TMUs and 6GB of RAM. By this time Nvidia was managing to squeeze as many as seven billion transistors into its GPUs.\n\nThe GeForce 700 series was designed to maximise energy efficiency but also included other features such as hardware H.264 encoding, PCI Express 3.0 interface, support for DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4a 4K x 2K video output as well as GPU-Boost 2.0.\n\nNvidia GeForce 900 series\n\nIn 2014 Nvidia seemingly skipped a generation and went straight into the GeForce 900 series. This was the introduction to the Maxwell microarchitecture which offered improved graphics capabilities as well as better energy efficiency.\n\nThis series had the GeForce GTX 980 as its initial flagship, later followed by the 980 Ti and GeForce GTX TITAN X at the extreme end.\n\nNVENC was also improved for this series and support appeared for Direct3D 12_1, OpenGL 4.6, OpenCL 3.0 and Vulkan 1.3.\n\nNvidia GeForce10 series\n\nIn 2014 Nvidia revealed the GeForce10 series based on the Pascal microarchitecture. The GTX 1080 Ti is perhaps the most well-known of the GPUs from this series and cemented itself in history as perhaps one of the most significant cards Nvidia released.\n\nThis graphics card dominated the market and offered such superb performance and energy efficiency vs cost that it would often be referred to when compared with future GPUs.\n\nThe 10 series also included new features such as GPU Boost 3.0, a dynamic load balancing scheduling system, triple buffering and support for both DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0b.\n\nNvidia GeForce20 series\n\nThe GeForce 20 series was released in 2018 and introduced the Turing microarchitecture to the world.\n\nNotably, these graphics cards were the first-gen of RTX cards and saw Nvidia pushing ray tracing as the main selling point.\n\nThe use of Tensor Cores and other enhancements helped these cards present a massive leap in graphical prowess. Resulting in realistic lighting and convincing reflection effects in-game.\n\nImprovements came at a cost though, with the RTX 2080 Ti retailing for an eye-watering $1,199 (compared to the $699 of the 1080 Ti).\n\nNvidia GeForce30 series\n\nThe GeForce30 series succeeded the 20 series in 2020 and unfortunately became most well-known for simply being impossible to get hold of due to the silicone shortage.\n\nStill, the Nvidia RTX 3080 was meant to retail for $699 making it much more affordable than the previous generations flagship and the series bought significant improvements too.\n\nThe flagship GeForce RTX 3090 Ti announced in March 2022 packed 10,752 CUDA cores, 78 RT-TFLOPs, 40 Shader-TFLOPs and 320 Tensor-TFLOPs of power. This powerful beast was also noted to be power-hungry, requiring at least 850 watts of power meaning you\'d likely need a 1,000-watt PSU to run it.\n\nNvidia GeForce 40-series\n\nNvidia has constantly been trying to push the boundaries with each iteration. With the RTX 40-series, one user proved it was possible to run games at 13K resolution.\n\nThis was the first series of GPUs to use the 12VHPWR connector which led to some problems, but otherwise mostly had glowing reviews.\n\nThe flagship card of this range, the RTX 4090, had 24GB of GDDR6X, 16384 Cuda cores and some serious processing power. With these cards, Nvidia also introduced DLSS 3.\n\nAsus\' latest phone beats the competition in 4 key ways, but you can\'t buy it in the US\n\nThe Zenfone 12 Ultra is Asus\' best flagship yet – here are 4 reasons why I hope it eventually lands on US shores.\n\nWhy I won\'t be making the jump from Chromecast to Google TV Streamer\n\nThe Google TV Streamer just isn\'t doing it for me.\n\nIf I come over to your house, I\'m changing these TV settings ASAP\n\nFrom spyware to presets, improve the look and performance of any smart TV with a few quick changes.\n\n4 Kindle secrets I use to get books for cheap or free\n\nYou can bulk up your Kindle ebook library without selling a kidney in the process - here are some of the best lesser-known methods.\n\nDon\'t even think about buying an OLED TV without learning about this first\n\nNew and enhanced OLED TVs make for a brighter and more colorful future.\n\nNexus 7 Pixel edition: it\'s time for Google to resurrect the greatest tablet ever\n\nBack in 2012, Google teamed up with Asus to launch the Nexus 7, a mini Android tablet - today, I\'m still holding out hope for a Pixel Tablet Mini.\n\nReviews\n\nEditorials\n\nAn almost-perfect Kindle?

Few could have predicted that this Silicon Valley start-up would one day become the world\'s most valuable semiconductor company.\n\nA mere $500 investment in Nvidia\'s IPO would be worth $1.88 million today, assuming dividends were reinvested, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\n\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\n\nLet\'s explore how this remarkable transformation unfolded, from its humble beginnings in a California diner to its current position at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nA vision that transformed computing\n\nNvidia\'s journey began in a Denny\'s restaurant near San Jose, where founders Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem sketched out their vision for revolutionizing computer graphics. Their innovation-the graphics processing unit (GPU)-would transform pixelated characters into lifelike images.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company\'s initial focus on gaming would later prove crucial to its expansion into AI and data centers. This foundation in gaming technology provided the expertise needed for future breakthroughs.\n\nThe parallel processing breakthrough\n\nNvidia\'s spectacular rise stems from its pioneering GPU architecture, which executes millions of calculations simultaneously. While this parallel processing capability first transformed gaming graphics, it later proved ideally suited for AI applications.\n\nToday, Nvidia\'s chips serve as the computational backbone for a vast ecosystem--from autonomous vehicles to major cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The adaptability of GPU technology has unlocked multiple high-growth markets, suggesting the company\'s technological advantages may only be beginning to bear fruit.\n\nA history of strategic adaptation\n\nNvidia\'s ability to pivot into new markets has been remarkable. The company recognized early that its GPU technology could extend beyond gaming.\n\nIn 2006, Nvidia unveiled the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), a breakthrough platform that transformed its graphics processors into versatile computing engines. This strategic innovation proved prescient, positioning Nvidia at the vanguard of the AI revolution.\n\nBy enabling GPUs to handle complex computational tasks beyond graphics, CUDA helped Nvidia build an unprecedented competitive advantage in what would become one of the world\'s most lucrative and transformative technology markets.\n\nThe AI catalyst\n\nThe rise of AI has supercharged Nvidia\'s growth. The company\'s data center revenue reached $26.3 billion in the latest quarter, representing a 154% increase year over year.\n\nThe AI boom has propelled Nvidia to a market value of $3.47 trillion today. Earlier this year, the chip maker briefly surpassed fellow tech behemoths Microsoft and Apple to become the world\'s most valuable publicly traded company.\n\nA stock split success story\n\nStock splits have played a significant role in Nvidia\'s shareholder-friendly approach. The company has conducted six splits since going public, most recently a 10-for-1 split in June 2024.\n\nThrough these splits, one original share has multiplied into 480 shares, making the stock more accessible to individual investors. Each split has maintained the same market value while increasing the number of shares available.\n\nWhere is Nvidia headed?\n\nNvidia is charting an ambitious course with its next-generation Blackwell architecture, engineered specifically for AI workloads. Industry analysts project these chips will drive billions in revenue by early 2025. CEO Jensen Huang envisions a $100 trillion AI economy, suggesting the semiconductor industry\'s transformation is just beginning.\n\nThe company\'s extensive R&D investments, paired with its deepening foothold in enterprise AI solutions, indicate its remarkable growth trajectory may still be in its early stages. Through strategic alliances with major cloud providers and robotics innovators, plus an expanding portfolio of software solutions, Nvidia appears well-positioned to capitalize on the next wave of AI adoption.\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\'s board of directors. George Budwell has positions in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft.

High inflation suppressed consumer demand for gaming chips in the second quarter, causing its revenue and gross profit margin to fall far short of guidance. More recently, worrisome news regarding its China business has given investors another reason to sell, and shares currently trade 63% off their all-time high.\nThat said, Nvidia has still been an incredible investment over the long term. Since its initial public offering (IPO) on Jan. 22, 1999, the stock has soared more than 29,700%. That means an initial investment of $5,000 would now be worth more than $1.4 million.\nIs this growth stock still a buy?\nShaping the future of graphics and artificial intelligence\nIn 1999, Nvidia\'s invention of the graphics processing unit (GPU) brought revolutionary visual effects to video games and films, and that spark started its meteoric rise through the ranks of the semiconductor industry. Nvidia GPUs -- chips designed to quickly perform complex math -- have since seen widespread adoption in data centers, where they accelerate workloads like data science and artificial intelligence (AI).\nToday, Nvidia holds more than 90% market share in workstation graphics and supercomputer accelerators, and Forrester Research recently said Nvidia GPUs have become synonymous with AI infrastructure. Indeed, the company has consistently delivered record-breaking results at the MLPerf benchmarks, a series of objective tests that measure the performance of AI hardware and software.\nNvidia has also extended its portfolio beyond hardware into subscription software and developer tools. For instance, AI Enterprise is a suite of software that helps businesses build and deploy AI applications across a range of end markets, including retail, healthcare, cybersecurity, and manufacturing.\nSimilarly, its Omniverse platform allows creators to collaborate on 3D design projects -- such as building virtual worlds for the metaverse -- and it allows engineers to run simulations that generate synthetic data for training the AI models that power autonomous robots and self-driving cars.\nThat broad portfolio has strengthened Nvidia\'s data center business, and it has led to solid financial results over the long term, despite a disappointing performance in the most recent quarter.\nMetric\nQ2 2021\nQ2 2023\nCAGR\nRevenue (TTM)\n$13.1 billion\n$29.7 billion\n51%\nEarnings per diluted share (TTM)\n$1.36\n$3.05\n50%\nData source: YCharts. TTM = trailing-12-months. CAGR = compound annual growth rate. Note: fiscal Q2 2023 ended July 31, 2022.\nLooking ahead, management puts its addressable market at $1 trillion, and Nvidia\'s capacity for innovation should keep it on the cutting edge of graphics and AI.\nFor instance, the company is set to debut its first central processing unit (CPU) in the first half of 2023, making its data center portfolio more comprehensive. Similarly, H100 data center GPUs built on the new Hopper architecture are now in full production, with an initial launch slated for this October. Hopper offers an order-of-magnitude performance increase compared to data center chips built on its previous Ampere architecture.\nLastly, Nvidia recently announced its next-generation Ada Lovelace GPU architecture for gaming and graphics chips, bringing up to fourfold-better performance to consumer use cases.\nGeopolitical risk in China\nIn late August, Nvidia informed investors that the U.S. government had imposed new license requirements for exports to China and Russia. The restrictions apply to its A100 and H100 data center chips, and any future semiconductors that meet or exceed the performance of its A100 chips. The U.S. government hopes those requirements will prevent Nvidia\'s fastest chips from being used in military applications in China and Russia.\nAt the time, Nvidia said its third-quarter guidance included $400 million in potential sales to China that could be impacted if the U.S. government does not grant licenses in a timely manner. That figure accounts for roughly 7% of its sales forecast for the third quarter, though China accounted for 26% of revenue in fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 30, 2022).\nInvestors should watch this situation closely. Nvidia is undoubtedly subject to geopolitical risk due to its business in China. That said, CEO Jensen Huang recently provided some upbeat insight into the situation, noting that the vast majority of Chinese customers would not be affected.\nPricey valuation\nNvidia is currently the second-most-valuable semiconductor company in the world, behind Taiwan Semiconductor, and it trades at a pricey 40.1 times earnings, a sizable premium compared to many of its peers. However, that looks cheap compared to its five-year average of 57.6 times earnings, and management believes its gross profit margins will improve as software becomes a larger part of total sales. That means Nvidia\'s bottom line could grow more quickly than its top line, bringing its price-to-earnings ratio down in a hurry.\nMore broadly, Nvidia is a high-quality business that is shaping the future of AI, virtual reality, and other trendy technologies. For that reason, investors interested in owning this stock will probably have to pay a premium regardless of when they decide to buy. With that in mind, I think investors should consider buying a few shares of this growth stock today, though the odds of 29,700% returns over the next two decades are virtually nonexistent.\nTrevor Jennewine has positions in Nvidia.
